# TravelingTournamentProblemVisualizer

The inital goal was to schedule a fixed amount of teams (16) on a timetable with 11 locations and 11 timeslots. Each team plays against another team at a timeslot (3 slots will be empty). The best case would be each team plays one time against an other team and always on a different location.

## The visualizer validates all constraints
- 16 Teams on each timeslot, each team can play only once a given time
- Each Team should play only once at each location
- Each Team should play as less as possible against an other team. This is maybe not solvable but with the visualizer it will be clear which can be optimized.

## Filled files
In the assets folder there is one filled file (as shown on the screenshot) its mostly optimized and has no errors. But some teams play three times against each other. That could maybe optimized.
